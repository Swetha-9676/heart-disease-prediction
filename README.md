# ❤️ Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Description
This project predicts whether a patient has heart disease based on medical attributes such as age,
blood pressure, cholesterol level, ECG results, and other vitals.

The model is trained using patient data and can classify a person as:
- 0 → Normal
- 1 → Heart Disease

---

## 🎯 Objective
To build a machine learning model that can help in early detection of heart disease.

---

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset contains patient medical records with the following features:
- Age
- Sex
- Chest pain type
- Resting blood pressure
- Serum cholesterol
- Fasting blood sugar
- Resting ECG
- Maximum heart rate
- Exercise induced angina
- Oldpeak
- ST slope

Target:
- 0 = Normal
- 1 = Heart Disease

---

## 🧠 Model Used
- Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
- Logistic Regression (optional comparison)

---

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- TensorFlow / Keras

---

## 📊 Results
The model achieved good accuracy in predicting heart disease based on patient data.

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements
- Deploy as a Streamlit web application
- Add real-time patient input
- Improve accuracy using hyperparameter tuning
